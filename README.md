## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the results of the 2024 General Elections in India. It uses SQL queries to manage and analyze data related to constituencies, candidates, political parties, and election outcomes. The goal is to perform detailed analysis and generate insights, such as the total number of seats won by alliances, distribution of votes, and comparison of results across states.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the election results to uncover significant insights and trends. Key areas of exploration include:

üìä Distribution of leading parties across constituencies.

üèÖ Margin of victory in different constituencies.

üìà Comparison between leading and trailing parties.

üì¢ Status of election results.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**:The project starts by creating a database named india_election_result_analysis_db.

- **Table Creation**: A table named constituencywise_details, constituencywise_results, partywise_results, states and statewise_results are created to store the data.

create table constituencywise_details(

no int primary key,

candidate varchar(100),

party varchar(100),

EVM_votes int,

postal_votes int,

total_votes int,

percentage_of_votes float,

constituency_id varchar(50));


drop table constituencywise_details


create table constituencywise_results(

no int,

parliament_constituency varchar(100) primary key,

constituency_name varchar(100),

winning_candidate varchar(150),	

total_votes int,

margin int,

constituency_id varchar(100),	

party_id int,

foreign key(constituency_id)references constituencywise_details(constituency_id));


drop table constituencywise_results

create table partywise_results(

party varchar(50),

won int,

party_id int);

drop table partywise_results

create table states(

stae_id varchar(10),

state varchar(100));

drop table partywise_results

create table statewise_results(

constituency varchar(100),

const_no int,

parliament_constituency varchar(100),

leading_candidate varchar(100),

trailing_candidate varchar(100),

margin int);
